## Crate: crust-rt

- **`crust-rt`** (lib name `crust_rt`) — the intersection kernel, factored out the way
  `openqmc-rs` was, behind a deliberately **Embree-shaped API**: `Geometry` values
  (triangle meshes with optional per-vertex shading normals, analytic spheres, disks
  and open cylinders — the last two exist for UsdLux's `DiskLight` / `CylinderLight` —
  round curve segments, `Instance`s — which nest — with transform motion blur) attach to a
  `SceneBuilder` with per-geometry visibility masks; `commit()` builds the acceleration
  structure; `Scene::intersect`/`Scene::occluded` mirror `rtcIntersect1`/`rtcOccluded1`.
  Hits are plain `Copy` `RayHit`s carrying `geom_id`/`prim_id` — the kernel never sees
  materials. Instanced hits report the *instance's* top-level `geom_id` with the inner
  `prim_id`. Internals: watertight Woop-2013 triangles, rounded-cone curves, and the
  parallel deterministic SBVH build collapsed to BVH4 (details below). Depends only on
  glam + rayon; deliberately swappable for Embree bindings behind the same seam.

## Geometry and intersection

- **Geometry & intersection** — there is no `Hittable` trait anymore: all intersection
  lives in the **`crust-rt`** kernel crate (see the workspace layout), and crust-core
  talks to it through `rt_world.rs`: a `WorldBuilder` pairs every attached
  `rt::Geometry` with its `Arc<dyn Material>` (`attach(...) -> geom_id`), and the
  committed `World` resolves kernel hits back to materials **by `geom_id`** —
  `World::intersect` returns a `WorldHit { rec: HitRecord, mat, geom_id, prim_id }`,
  `World::occluded` is the shadow-ray early-exit query (NEE never uses closest-hit).
  `HitRecord` (`hittable.rs`) remains the material-facing `Copy` hit geometry (point,
  ray-facing normal, `t`, `front_face`). Inside the kernel: `Sphere`,
  triangles with one shared **watertight** intersector (Woop et al. 2013 — dominant-axis
  shear, 2D edge functions with f64 fallback on exact-zero ties; no pinholes along
  shared edges), `RoundCurves` (sphere-swept cones for hair), and `Instance` (a
  committed inner `rt::Scene` placed by a transform — rays transform into local space
  with unnormalized direction so `t` carries over, normals map back by
  inverse-transpose; an optional end-of-shutter transform lerps per-ray for motion
  blur). Per-geometry masks gate intersection on `ray.mask` (`MASK_*` consts,
  re-exported from the kernel). The build is reference-based **SBVH** (binned object
  SAH + spatial splits gated by the α-overlap test, references clipped via exact
  Sutherland-Hodgman for triangles and duplicated across children), runs subtrees in
  parallel via `rayon::join` above 4096 refs, is **deterministic** (input-only
  decisions, pinned by a build-twice test), and is then **collapsed to BVH4**: 128-byte
  4-wide SoA nodes whose slab tests run on `Vec4` lanes (`safe_inv3` keeps
  zero-direction components NaN-free; closest-hit traversal orders lanes near-to-far,
  occlusion traversal early-exits). Traversal is mask-driven: `RaySlab` pre-splats the
  ray once per query, `cmple(..).bitmask()` yields all four lane verdicts at once, and
  a validity nibble in `WideNode::flags` masks unused lanes (they cannot just be given
  empty bounds — the slab test's per-axis min/max un-inverts an inverted box).
  Leaf payloads live in a side `Leaf` table (keeping the node at two cache lines), and
  each leaf's triangles are packed into **4-wide `Tri4` SIMD packets**: the Woop shear
  is per-*ray* (`RayShear`, derived once per traversal), so four triangles are
  intersected per vector round, with lanes whose edge functions come out exactly `0.0`
  handed back to the scalar path for its f64 tie-break — watertightness intact. The
  packet and scalar intersectors are **bit-identical** (pinned by
  `simd_matches_scalar_bitwise`); change one and you must change the other.
  `MIN_LEAF_PACKED` (4) is the leaf floor for all-triangle ranges so packets fill,
  while non-packable prims keep `MIN_LEAF` (2) — see `docs/simd.md` for the audit,
  the measurements, and why `std::simd` is not used (nightly-only on stable).

## Known gaps: geometry and acceleration

- **Geometry/acceleration caveats.** Motion blur is transform-only and lerps the *matrix*
  linearly (no deformation blur, no quaternion motion — a large shutter rotation bows
  slightly, but the union-of-endpoints bbox stays conservative). Cubic curve spans are
  kept as cubic primitives (converted to Bézier control points) and adaptively
  subdivided per ray query into rounded cones (`crust_rt::curve::cubic_curve_intersect`),
  so they are not stored as polylines; widths lerp across a span in parameter; the
  rounded-cone can report an interior sphere surface for rays *starting inside* the hull (irrelevant for opaque hair). Mesh-BVH sharing needs identical
  points/topology *and* material binding. Emissive curves/instances are not light-list
  entries (BSDF-sampled only, like emissive volumes).
  Baking single-placement meshes (above) leaves *resident* memory unchanged — the same
  triangles, one fewer BVH — but it moves work into a single large top-level SBVH build,
  and that build's **transient** peak is higher: on `Kitchen_set` (1 394 meshes baked,
  414 599 top-level triangles) kernel memory went 134.59 → 134.44 MiB while peak RSS went
  374 → 579 MiB. The cause is pre-existing and not specific to baking: `PrimRef` and the
  binary `Node` are 48 bytes each, and `merge` concatenates child node arrays while both
  children are still alive, so one build over ~600 K references (with SBVH duplication)
  transiently holds a few hundred MiB where 1 788 small builds held almost nothing. If that
  peak ever matters more than the ~20% render win, the lever is a triangle-count cap on
  baking; the real fix is a builder that does not materialise the whole binary tree.
  Subdivision surfaces sharpen this: a level-L cage feeds 4^L× more triangles into the
  same build, and on the `gen_subdiv_stress.py` scene at level 4 the SBVH commit peak
  (2.19 GiB) is nearly twice the refiner's own traverse-phase peak (1.16 GiB) — so the
  build transient, not opensubdiv, is the first lever if a subdivided scene runs out of
  memory. Within `subdivide()` itself the tail holds ~5 copies of the last level's
  positions (`verts`, `limit`, `points`, `verts_a`, `normals`) plus the whole retained
  refiner; restructuring to drop the refiner before the copies would shave roughly a
  third off its ~313 B/face transient if that ever matters.

## Known gaps: SIMD stops at 128 bits

- **SIMD stops at 128 bits** (`docs/simd.md` has the audit and the numbers). Everything
  vectorized — `glam`'s `Vec3A`/`Vec4`, the BVH4 slab test, `Tri4` leaf packets — is
  SSE2/NEON-width, because `std::simd` is still nightly-only and crust builds on stable.
  Current practice says target AVX2 instead, so the reasons not to are recorded: merely
  *enabling* AVX2 codegen is worth 2–4% (LLVM cannot widen a 4-lane algorithm), and
  8-wide leaf packets would buy exactly nothing because no leaf holds more than 4
  triangles — pinned by `eight_wide_packets_would_not_reduce_vector_rounds`. **BVH8
  nodes** are the one place 256-bit vectors would still pay, and that is a project
  decision, not just an optimization: reaching 256 bits at *runtime* needs `unsafe`
  `core::arch` intrinsics (against this crate's "100% safe Rust" claim), a new
  dependency (`wide`/`multiversion`), or a non-distributable `-C target-cpu`.
  Also: only *triangles* pack — sphere, curve and instance leaves still run scalar (no
  `Sphere4`); rays are traced one at a time, so there is no coherent ray-packet tracing
  (that needs the integrator restructured, not just the kernel); and the checked-in
  sample scenes are shading-bound, so kernel speedups barely show up there — use
  `scripts/gen_stress_scene.py` to benchmark traversal changes end to end.
